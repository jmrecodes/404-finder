# 404 Finder Chrome Extension

A powerful Chrome extension that automatically detects and tracks 404 errors while browsing the web. It can identify both hard 404s (HTTP status code 404) and soft 404s (pages that return 200 but display 404 content).

## Features

- **Automatic 404 Detection**: Detects both HTTP 404 errors and soft 404s
- **Smart Content Analysis**: Uses advanced pattern matching to identify error pages
- **Domain Management**: Whitelist or blacklist domains for monitoring
- **Search Engine Integration**: Quickly search for broken links across multiple search engines
- **Real-time Notifications**: Get notified when 404 errors are detected
- **Error History**: Track and export all detected 404 errors
- **Badge Counter**: Shows error count directly on the extension icon
- **Customizable Settings**: Configure detection sensitivity and notification preferences
